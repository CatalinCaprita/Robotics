## General Info
---
 The project represents an interactive applpication that consolidates what the Introduction To Robotics course
aims at : understanding of basic robotics notions such as interactions fiwth several components of and arduino kit as well
as understading the Arduino programming language. It is an implementation of a shooter-style arcade game
drawinf heavy inspiration from "Space-Invaders" on an 8x8 LED Matrix. Additionally, the player is presented
with a menu on an LCD controller, with several options such as adding a name, setting contrast or viewing
information about the game.

## How To Play?
###'What's my Goal?'
---
  Be the hero of our Planet! Use your in-built ship guns to destroy as many enemy space-ships as possible! 
Be aware that the extraterrestrials will not stand and embrace their end. they fight back as well! Work your way up
through the levels up to the final Boss of the System!

###'How do I play ?'
  Using the joystick, you can move left, right up and down. By pressing the joystick's button you can shoot
the enemies. If any of your projectiles targets an enemy space-ship, you are awarded with 10 points. Each time
an enemy projectile hits you, you lose one of your lives. 
  You start with 3 lives, at level 1. Each time you score another 100 points , you are awarded an extra life. Use them
wisely!Each time you clear all the enemy space-ships you reach a new level. Each level progresses in difficulty by means 
of the movement pattern of the ships, as well as the number of simultaneous projectiles coming your way. In each elvel, each enemy
is likely to have between 1 and the level number of lives so if they don't get eliminated at first, keep on shooting!
